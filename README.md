# cel-gun

cel-gun is a testing utility meant to be used to load test a given celestia protocol.

Currently, it only supports load for `shrex-nd` on the `mammoth` testnet.

## TODO 

- [ ] run against resource unlimited node to completion
- [ ] make it extensible to any celestia protocol + any message type
- [ ] allow more than one message to be sent (randomised messages w/ some bogus requests)
- [ ] add proper telemetry rather than prints
